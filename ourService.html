                        <p>The VoIP telephony (Voice-over-IP) carries phone calls over an IP data network, whether on the internet or your own internal network.</p>

                        <p>The main advantage of using VoIP is the saving of cost calls since calls pass directly via the IP network and not through the network of a phone provider. </p>
